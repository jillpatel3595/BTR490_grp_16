Here in this project we will be working with React to develop website. So, we have decided to work on the services like OpenWeaherMap or something related to weather services. For this for the back-end we will work with ExpressJs, Database with MongoDb and the Front-end with React. We will be using API services smoothly to get data. 

We are using **Discord** as a medium to share ideas with eachother and arrange a voice meeting with eachother in order to discuss the project. Everyone gave their own ideas and we mutually decided to work the above described project. We are considering everyone ideas and we will focus on keeping evryone together.
