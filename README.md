Overview: In our project we will be creating a system in which manager can make changes to the data and can easily login and logout from the system.

The technologies that we will use will be JSwing, Apache to link our application to phpMyAdmin. We opted to use mySql using localhost XAMPP, which is used to test clients or websites before they are published to a distant web server so we explored some websites and videos.
